# YYYY-MMM: Lang team update

## Summary

* Summarizes the key points here! 
* These should be in a format suitable to be copied-and-pasted into a "lang team monthly updates" blog post.
* This is great place to give a shout out to contributors.

## Goals for this month

* Outline the things you would like to achieve this month
* Best is if you can make these fairly concrete:
    * "Extend evaluation doc to cover XXX"
    * "Find a solution for #12345"

## Questions for discussion, meeting proposals

* Outline anything where you would like feedback from the broader lang team or community

## (Other topic)

* Add additional `##` headings for topics that you'd like to cover in more detail.
    * For example, you could add a section to dive into details from the summary, or to explain a new approach that you decided to take (and why).
    * Please include links into the explainers, evaluation, github issues, etc where applicable!
